AI4SocialGood Final Project: Braille to text converter (Optical Character Recognition/Optical Braille Recognition)

<b>The main objectives of this project are to raise awareness of Braille and to bridge the gap of communication between blind and non-blind people.</b>

## About us ##
We are a group of four undergraduate female students in computer science who were part of the AI4SocialGood Lab 2018 at McGill University. Throughout the first 2 weeks of the lab, we learned about AI and machine learning techniques and are now applying this knowledge to solve a social problem.

## Introduction ##
Based on personal experience, we felt that there wasn't enough technology out there to help non-blind people interact and communicate with blind people. So, we decided to create a braille-to-text converter that is able to take an image of a line (a word, sentence, or a character) of Braille, recognize it, and output its English counterpart. Using data acquired from rare book collections and the internet, we constructed our own dataset consisting of multiple sets of the Braille alphabet, numbers, and symbols. We then trained an AI that will recognize images of individual Braille characters and translate them into English characters. Using a specific ratio and cropping function, we are able to take an image of a sentence/line of Braille and segment each Braille character out individually. We feed each of these characters into our model and then concatenate the output characters together into an English sentence or word.

Our model is able to recognize all the letters in the alphabet, capital letters, numbers, commas, periods, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, colons, semicolons, question marks, and exclamation marks. Please refer to the chart below.

Our Android app has a cropping function that allows users to take a picture or choose an image of Braille and crop it to get rid of white space around the characters. This cropping functionality is important because our AI uses ratio image segmentation to distinguish different Braille characters. We were able to successfully import and load our model in Android Studio. Unfortunately, due to errors with some kernel operations from using Tensorflow with Android Studio, we were not able to feed our Braille images into our model. [We have posted this error on StackOverFlow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50955816/java-lang-illegalargumentexception-no-opkernel-was-registered-to-support-op-ga). For the time being, we will use our website as the main Braille-to-Text converter.

## Open Source Dataset ##
Since we were not able to find an open source or public dataset of images of English Grade 1 Braille, we are planning on releasing our own dataset to be downloaded and used for free. At the moment, we have approximately 30,000 Braille characters in our dataset and are continuing to add more.

## Future Goals ##
1. Increase our dataset to 100,000 images
2. Use image segmentation
3. Debug kernel errors in our Android app
4. Host our website
